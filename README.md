# Cleaning a Dataset using R
This project is a part of the Coursera course **Getting and Cleaning Data** offered by *Johns Hopkins University* as a part of their
online Data Science specialization programme.<br/> <br/>
The **problem statement** is as follows:
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example
[this](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/)
article.
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

[Here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) are the data for the project.<br/><br/>
You should create one R script called *run_analysis.R* that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
